# lospec2css is a simple script to convert a downloaded lospec color palette
# into a CSS file with each color set as a variable. You will have to manually
# name the colors, unfortunately.
#
# You can download the file needed from a specific palette page. Under the
# "Download" section, click the "HEX File" option. This will be your input file.
#
# Usage:
#   python lospec2css.py input.txt output.css
def main(input: str, output: str):
    # If the input file extension wasn't provided, we can add it.
    if not input.endswith(".hex"):

    with open(input, 'r') as file:
        palette = file.read().splitlines()

    # If the output file extension wasn't provided, we can add it.
    if not output.endswith(".css"):
        output += ".css"

    # their own file, or just use the file itself.
